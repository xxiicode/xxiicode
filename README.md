## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Lean, a dedicated front-end developer focused on continuous learning and improvement.

Iâ€™m passionate about building clean, scalable, and efficient code, while also developing my skills to become a top professional in the tech world.

Hereâ€™s a little about me:

- ðŸ”­ My journey began as a front-end dev in a startup, where I deeply learned the fundamentals of frontend development. Now, we are exploring design systems, Sass, and Tailwind CSS.
- ðŸš€ As a personal improve, Iâ€™m working on my firsts React projects, hands-on experience to deepen my understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m studying a higher technical degree in programming, where Iâ€™m learning more about object-oriented programming and system development in JS and C#.
- ðŸ‘¾ My goal is to continue advancing in my career by mastering modern web development technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and becoming a well-rounded full-stack developer.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source front-end projects or any interesting full-stack web development initiatives to challenge myself and learn from others.
- ðŸ“« Looking forward to new opportunities and work. You can reach me through my GitHub or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leanbilokapic/).

- âš¡ Fun fact: I live in Croatia but Iâ€™m originally from Argentina. I have a deep interest in coding, and Iâ€™m also passionate about drawing, nature, and the PokÃ©mon TCG!
